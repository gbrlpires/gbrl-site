"The Creative Database is an ongoing project to archive and document creatives from various disciplines, including design, fine art, sound art, writing, film, fashion and photography. The Creative Database is an online space that champions creatives of all disciplines who do not tend to be celebrated in traditional and mainstream media, centring the achievements of people of colour in particular."
